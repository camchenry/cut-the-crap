# Cut the Crap

Cut the Crap is a browser extension to remove annoying, useless, or distracting elements from a webpage. For example,
it removes references to Shorts in YouTube, and removes the Trending section on Twitter.

> This extension is very experimental and still in development. I wouldn't recommend depending on it for day-to-day use.
